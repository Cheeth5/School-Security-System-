# system design

for the system design i took an Asus x540l mother board put it in a new base and i added a camera to it , i also used a voltage step-down to convert the 19v of the mother board 
to a 12 v to make the TV display work . 
Using a python program the camera captures the person face and compares it to the image saved in the directory file and it shows on the display a note "Hi{name}"
